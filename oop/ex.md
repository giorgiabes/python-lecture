# Exercises

## ex1.py

Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The `__init__()` method for
Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
Make a method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two pieces of
information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message
indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes
individually, and then call both methods.

## ex2.py

Three Restaurants: Start with your class from "ex2.py" Create three
different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each
instance.

## ex3.py

Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and
last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
of the user’s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
for each user.

## ex4.py

Number Served: Start with your program from "ex1.py"
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
print the value again.

Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
the number of customers who’ve been served. Call this method with any num-
ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
day of business.

## ex5.py

Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User
class from Exercise 3. Write a method called increment_login_attempts()
that increments the value of login_attempts by 1. Write
another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_
attempts to 0.

Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several
times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
properly, and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to
make sure it was reset to 0.
